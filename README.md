Twitter Bootstrap for Maven
=============
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/efsavage/Bootstrap-Maven.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/efsavage/Bootstrap-Maven)

This library gives you a way to drop [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) into your project as a [Maven](maven.apache.org) dependency, which means you don't have to include these third party files in your own source control.

pom.xml
-------

Add this to the <dependencies> element of your pom.xml.  The artifact is deployed to the Maven Central Repository.

	<dependency>
    	<groupId>com.efsavage.twitter.bootstrap</groupId>
    	<artifactId>bootstrap-maven</artifactId>
    	<version>2.3.1</version>
	</dependency>

Usage
-------
The files will "mount" themselves at the following URLs:

* /ext/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css
* /ext/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-responsive.css
* /ext/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.js
* /ext/bootstrap/img/glyphicons-halflings.png (referenced from the css files)
* /ext/bootstrap/img/glyphicons-halflings-white.png (referenced from the css files)

Requirements
-------

This requires a Servlet 3.0 container, such as Jetty 8.

Minified vs. Full Versions
-------
The minified versions of .css and .js files are used by default, append ?min=false to see the full versions.

Taglib
-------
This library contains a tld and tag files which will automatically be available to your web application when the jar is loaded.  To include the tag library on your JSP page, include the following directive at the top:

    <%@ taglib uri="http://efsavage.com/twitter-bootstrap" prefix="bs" 

You can then use the tags as specified in the taglibs.md file.  For example:

    <bs:button text="Go" />

will render to:

    <button class="btn" type="button">Go</button>

Modifications
-------
The files served have not been modified in any way from their original distribution.

* [Backbone.js for Maven](https://github.com/efsavage/Backbone-Maven)
